# Murmur configuration file.
#
# General notes:
# * Settings in this file are default settings and many of them can be overridden
#   with virtual server specific configuration via the Ice or DBus interface.
# * Due to the way this configuration file is read some rules have to be
#   followed when specifying variable values (as in variable = value):
#     * Make sure to quote the value when using commas in strings or passwords.
#        NOT variable = super,secret BUT variable = "super,secret"
#     * Make sure to escape special characters like '\' or '"' correctly
#        NOT variable = """ BUT variable = "\""
#        NOT regex = \w* BUT regex = \\w*

# Path to database. If blank, will search for
# murmur.sqlite in default locations or create it if not found.

# If you wish to use something other than SQLite, you'll need to set the name
# of the database above, and also uncomment the below.
# Sticking with SQLite is strongly recommended, as it's the most well tested

# murmurd processes connected to the same D-Bus daemon.

# If you want to use ZeroC Ice to communicate with Murmur, you need
# to specify the endpoint to use. Since there is no authentication
# with ICE, you should only use it if you trust all the users who have
# shell access to your machine.
# Please see the ICE documentation on how to specify endpoints.
#ice="tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6502"

# Ice primarily uses local sockets. This means anyone who has a
# user account on your machine can connect to the Ice services.
# You can set a plaintext "secret" on the Ice connection, and
# any script attempting to access must then have this secret
# (as context with name "secret").
# Access is split in read (look only) and write (modify) 
# operations. Write access always includes read access,
# unless read is explicitly denied (see note below).
#
# Note that if this is uncommented and with empty content,
# access will be denied.
