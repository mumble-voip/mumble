/** \page page_streams Media Streams
 *
 * \section sec_overview Overview
 *
 * Media streams are used to exchange data with the PipeWire server. A
 * stream is a wrapper around a proxy for a \ref pw_client_node with
 * an adapter. This means the stream will automatically do conversion
 * to the type required by the server.
 *
 * Streams can be used to:
 *
 * \li Consume a stream from PipeWire. This is a PW_DIRECTION_INPUT stream.
 * \li Produce a stream to PipeWire. This is a PW_DIRECTION_OUTPUT stream
 *
 * You can connect the stream port to a specific server port or let PipeWire
 * choose a port for you.
 *
 * For more complicated nodes such as filters or ports with multiple
 * inputs and/or outputs you will need to use the pw_filter or make
 * a pw_node yourself and export it with \ref pw_core_export.
 *
 * \section sec_create Create
 *
 * Make a new stream with \ref pw_stream_new(). You will need to specify
 * a name for the stream and extra properties. You can use \ref
 * pw_fill_stream_properties() to get a basic set of properties for the
 * stream.
 *
 * Once the stream is created, the state_changed event should be used to
 * track the state of the stream.
 *
 * \section sec_connect Connect
 *
 * The stream is initially unconnected. To connect the stream, use
 * \ref pw_stream_connect(). Pass the desired direction as an argument.
 *
 * \subsection ssec_stream_target Stream target
 *
 * To make the newly connected stream automatically connect to an existing
 * PipeWire node, use the \ref PW_STREAM_FLAG_AUTOCONNECT and the port_path
 * argument while connecting.
 *
 * \subsection ssec_stream_formats Stream formats
 *
 * An array of possible formats that this stream can consume or provide
 * must be specified.
 *
 * \section sec_format Format negotiation
 *
 * After connecting the stream, the server will want to configure some
 * parameters on the stream. You will be notified of these changes
 * with the param_changed event.
 *
 * When a format param change is emitted, the client should now prepare
 * itself to deal with the format and complete the negotiation procedure
 * with a call to \ref pw_stream_update_params().
 *
 * As arguments to \ref pw_stream_update_params() an array of spa_param
 * structures must be given. They contain parameters such as buffer size,
 * number of buffers, required metadata and other parameters for the
 * media buffers.
 *
 * \section sec_buffers Buffer negotiation
 *
 * After completing the format negotiation, PipeWire will allocate and
 * notify the stream of the buffers that will be used to exchange data
 * between client and server.
 *
 * With the add_buffer event, a stream will be notified of a new buffer
 * that can be used for data transport. You can attach user_data to these
 * buffers.
 *
 * After the buffers are negotiated, the stream will transition to the
 * \ref PW_STREAM_STATE_PAUSED state.
 *
 * \section sec_streaming Streaming
 *
 * From the \ref PW_STREAM_STATE_PAUSED state, the stream can be set to
 * the \ref PW_STREAM_STATE_STREAMING state by the PipeWire server when
 * data transport is started.
 *
 * Depending on how the stream was connected it will need to Produce or
 * Consume data for/from PipeWire as explained in the following
 * subsections.
 *
 * \subsection ssec_consume Consume data
 *
 * The process event is emitted for each new buffer that can be
 * consumed.
 *
 * \ref pw_stream_dequeue_buffer() should be used to get the data and
 * metadata of the buffer.
 *
 * When the buffer is no longer in use, call \ref pw_stream_queue_buffer()
 * to let PipeWire reuse the buffer.
 *
 * \subsection ssec_produce Produce data
 *
 * \ref pw_stream_dequeue_buffer() gives an empty buffer that can be filled.
 *
 * Filled buffers should be queued with \ref pw_stream_queue_buffer().
 *
 * The process event is emitted when PipeWire has emptied a buffer that
 * can now be refilled.
 *
 * \section sec_stream_disconnect Disconnect
 *
 * Use \ref pw_stream_disconnect() to disconnect a stream after use.
