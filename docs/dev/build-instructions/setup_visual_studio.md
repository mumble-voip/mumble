# Setup Visual Studio

MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++) is Microsoftâ€™s C++ compiler toolchain. It can be installed from Visual Studio Build Tools, or Visual Studio Community.
Either can be downloaded [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads) (Any somewhat recent version should work).

Make sure to select the **C++ build tools** (or Development, respectively) and "**C++ MFC for latest v14[X] build tools**" (just pick the latest
version - e.g.v142). vcpkg also requires the **English Language pack** which is found in the Language packs section of the Visual Studio Installer.
