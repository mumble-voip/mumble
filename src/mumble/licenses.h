	"               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n"
	"\n"

	"               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n"

	"               Material.\n"
	"\n"

	"          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n"
	"          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n"

	"          Rights, but not otherwise.\n"

	"          context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n"
	"\n"
	"       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms\n"
	"          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological\n"

	"  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n"
	"     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n"
