# This file controls whether the translations found in this

# doesn't ship with its own translation for that locale or
# whether our translations are actually enforced (aka they

# A line starting with a # is interpreted as a comment and is
# discarded
# All non-empty lines that are no comment have to be in the format
# <operator> <fileName>

# To provide translation file x.ts as a fallback use
# fallback x.ts
# to force its usage use
# overwrite x.ts
