# Mumble plugin - Language bindings

## C

`C` is the native language of the plugin API. If you intend to use it, you don't need any special bindings.


## C++

There exists an official `C++` wrapper around the C API. It can be found at https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-plugin-cpp.

## Rust

`Rust` bindings are maintained independently from the main Mumble project. They can be found at https://crates.io/crates/mumble-sys.
