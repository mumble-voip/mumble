The files in this directory are originally from an article
in Qt Quarterly 23:

https://doc.qt.io/archives/qq/qq23-bonjour.html

The files in this directory are used directly in the
Mumble and Murmur build. Because of this, there is no
"qqbonjour-build" directory.

These files are modified and are now de facto maintained by
the Mumble project.
